# Personal-Fitness-Tracker
It is imperative to have a regularly monitored healthy and active lifestyle, which means continual monitoring of fitness, calories burned, and individual health indicators. Yet, estimating the calories burnt while working out is not an easy feat for most individuals since most methods of tracking fitness use generalized estimates that do not take into account varying individual factors like age, body mass index, heart rate, and temperature. Wearable fitness trackers, though efficient, are usually costly and not within everyone's reach. In the absence of proper tracking, users are unable to set realistic fitness goals, track progress, and maximize workouts. To overcome these issues, this project seeks to create a Personal Fitness Tracker that offers real-time calorie forecasts based on user inputs, allowing users to make informed decisions to enhance their fitness levels.
