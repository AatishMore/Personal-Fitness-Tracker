# Personal-Fitness-Tracker
Having a healthy lifestyle requires tracking fitness, calories burned, and health parameters. Estimating calories burned is tough due to generalized methods ignoring age, BMI, heart rate, and temperature. Wearable trackers are costly. This project aims to create a Personal Fitness Tracker for real-time calorie predictions based on user inputs.
